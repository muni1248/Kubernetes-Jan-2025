what is ingress in kubernetes:
An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides a way to expose services to the outside world and can handle load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
Key Features of Ingress:
1.	Path-based Routing: Routes traffic to different services based on the URL path.
2.	Host-based Routing: Routes traffic to different services based on the host name.
3.	TLS/SSL Termination: Manages SSL certificates and terminates SSL/TLS connections.
4.	Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services.
Example of an Ingress Resource:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - example.com
    secretName: example-tls
In this example:
•	Traffic to example.com is routed to the example-service on port 80.
•	TLS termination is handled using the example-tls secret.
Ingress controllers, such as NGINX, Traefik, or HAProxy, are required to implement the Ingress resource and manage the routing.
