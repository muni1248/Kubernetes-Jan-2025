Load balancing algorithms are essential for distributing network traffic efficiently across multiple servers. They can be broadly categorized into static and dynamic algorithms:
Static Load Balancing Algorithms
1.	Round Robin: Distributes traffic sequentially across a list of servers.
2.	Weighted Round Robin: Assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity, distributing more traffic to higher-capacity servers.
3.	IP Hash: Uses a hash of the client's IP address to determine which server will handle the request.
Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms
1.	Least Connection: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
2.	Weighted Least Connection: Similar to least connection but considers server capacity by assigning weights.
3.	Least Response Time: Routes traffic to the server with the quickest response time.
4.	Resource-Based: Considers the current resource availability (CPU, memory) of each server before distributing traffic
These algorithms help ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving overall system performance and reliability. Do you have a specific scenario in mind where you need to implement load balancing?
